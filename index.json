These distributors and managed service providers all build their partner networks around the world. Their partners are deeply experienced with their specific system and ready to sell new subscriptions, but might lack the experience and expertise to build a tailor-made cloud solution. This is where a consultant company that onboarded several clients onto a diverse set of cloud systems could be worth its weight in gold.\nHave you recognized any of these challenges?\n Your use case is not typical, the vendor-committed company doesn’t provide a ready-to-use solution to this problem. Your issue seems to be small but finding a solution is time consuming. There is a function or service that is not optimal for your needs and you would like to replace it with something else. If you need help to efficiently implement your cloud native strategy, a cloud native consultant company could be the best choice.  At Origoss Solutions, we consider ourselves real cloud native system experts and we don’t limit our expertise and knowledge to any given system. We focus on our clients’ needs and concentrate on helping them to find the most efficient way to operate their cloud. This typically includes high level customization, integration of tailor-made functions, precise documentation, and training the systems operations staff. We can provide you with the necessary subscriptions, but our core business is to help you to onboard and operate your cloud-based solution like an expert.\nWe consider ourselves a Swiss Army knife of cloud native services. We support our clients with their migration to their chosen system, whether it’s a free solution (Vanilla Kubernetes, OKD), an on-premises solution (like OpenShift) or some big public cloud provider’s own fully managed Kubernetes service (EKS, AKS, GKE). As Origoss Solutions is a Kubernetes Certified Service Provider (KCSP) and Red Hat Premier Partner, the highest quality service is guaranteed. We are happy to be able to state that we have already managed migrations, and supported and improved already running projects on each and every popular and well-known cloud native public service for our clients. During our projects, we particularly focus on finding a solution for the client that doesn’t lock them in to one specific system or provider.\nFor us, cloud native consultancy means these capabilities. You can trust us with your questions or issues related to any cloud native projects. Feel free to pm me if you think we can help your company as well.\n","permalink":"/web-syna/blog/2020-05-14-cloud-diaries/","tags":null,"title":"Cloud Native Diaries - Shape the cloud, not the client"},{"categories":["blog","blog3"],"contents":"Blog 3\n","permalink":"/web-syna/blog/2020-05-08-blog3/","tags":null,"title":"Blog 3 title"},{"categories":null,"contents":"As a Kubernetes Certified Service Provider, we help to transforming legacy applications into cloud native environments.
